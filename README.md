# MonitorLuancher
[ In dire need of a better name! ]

## About

[INSERT_NAME] sole purpose is to start applications based on which screens are plugged in.

This is after production, meant to be compadible with the desktop customize-tool Rainmeter. 

You should be able to select screens either based on an arbitrary id or just based on screen 1, 2, 3 etc.



### Monitor ID
The monitor ID are not trully proper ID's, as I do not know and have not been able to find out about monitor ID's with C#, this does exclude the primary display thought. The secondary monitor, third monitor, and so on will be identified by thier setting's hash. That's because you typically does not change your monitor settings. Therefore it will work as an arbitrary ID.

### NAMING
Program needs a better name...

### Notes
Btw, this is written i C#
